To install:
- Make a backup of your "Tribes.exe" before you extract this.
- Extract "Tribes.exe" to your Tribes folder.
- Create a 1.41 shortcut just like for your 1.40 shortcut.
  - If you did this right, your old shortcut should work.
  - If you did this right, your Tribes should show "Version 1.41" in the bottom right when you start Tribes.

All plugins that worked with 1.40 will work with 1.41. You can use 1.41 on 1.11, 1.30 (LastHope), and even 1.40 servers. *NOTE* If you are using 1.41, you no longer need to use the HMCrasher.dll plugin.
