11. Included opencall 3 map pack
12. Added Information on all the fixes




Installation
1. Back up console.cs
2. Unzip to your Tribes 1.40 directory (should contain Tribes.exe) with
directory structure and overwrite existing console.cs file.
3. Restart Tribes and enjoy!

Issues?
$pref:terrainlodamount = 0; may cause video lag on lesser cards. 
To change:
1. Host a game and spawn. Move where you can see terrain. 
2. Hit the ` key in game to open console. 
3. Copy/ paste "$pref:terrainlodamount = 0.8;" without quotes into console, hit enter. The terrain should visibly change at distance.
4. Hit up arrow to repeat last entered command, and change the 0.8 to a value that suits you. Lower numbers = more accurate.
5. Remember this number and change it in config\autoexec.cs

Issuessss.
$pref::playerfov = 110; may be changed in the same manner. 


Thanks to Greyhound, Lemon, Opsayo, Shodan, and anyone else I forgot for sharing these fixes.

Specific information on the fixes:

1. Master server patch.	
	$Server::CurrentMaster = "0";$Server::MasterAddressN0 = "t1m1.tribes0.com:28000 t1m1.masters.tribesmasterserver.com:28000 t1m1.pu.net:28000 skbmaster.ath.cx:28000 kigen.ath.cx:28000 t1m1.masters.dynamix.com:28000";

2. Video Lag fix. 
	$pref::screensize = 1; For you ati users. Fixes sporadic video lag.

3. The open call map fix by Shodan
	So far the maps, that do not work in the above distribution, are:
	Opencall
	
	    Turbulence
	    SuperCross_2
	    Death_Row
	    TheLongWalk
	    Massive_Sides
	    OneSmallStep (OneSmallStep.ted is not converted to zip)
	    Slipstream
	
	This is because these files have no [Mapname].zip file. (The .vol of these in the 1.30 Distribution were empty.)
	To fix this create an empty zip-file named after the map (e.g. "Turbulence.zip" [22 bytes]) and copy it to the opencall directory (e.g. "c:\tribes1.40\opencall\" ).
	
	Open call 2
	
	    only Hildebrandt works.
	
	
	
	This is, because nobody took care of converting the .ted and .vol files to .zip-Format and putting them into the distribution.
	
	fix:
	get a copy of the "Open Call 2" Maps, unpack each .ted and .vol file on its own and then zip them. All unpacked .vol files will be named [Mapname].zip.
	All .ted files will keep the name [Mapname].ted!
	
	If nobody beats me to it, I will create a fixed mappack containing the missing files. Anybody wants to host that pack? I am to lazy to register some webspace right now.
	
	Since there are other map packs and mods out there, I think some of them might have the same problems with the 1.40 client as Opencall, so please leave a note in this thread, if you find this bug in other maps and mods.

4. Full screen fix: by Lemon 
	delete or comment out (//) line 332 in console.cs
	
	this is 331 and 332
	
	Code:
	
	// GDCHACK : don't go fullscreen on startup (currently borked in webpage) 
	   $pref::VideoFullScreen = "FALSE";

5. Flag hud fix: by Lemon
	This fix applies to players on active mode servers like US Base and The Community.
	
	    The built-in 1.40 flag hud doesn't update team scores when you join a server mid-game.
	    In config\Core\Team.cs make the following change.
	
	
	
	Instead of this:
	Code:
	
	function remoteTeamScore( %sv, %team, %score ) {
		//$Team::Score[%team] = %score;
	}
	
	
	Make it look like this:
	Code:
	
	function remoteTeamScore( %sv, %team, %score ) {
		$Team::Score[%team] = %score;
	}

6. IceridgeLT Fix:	by opsayo 
	go into lt/missions
	
	iceridegLT.zip -> iceridgeLT.zip
	
7. HUD position fix:	by GreyHound 
	Code:
	
	/* 
		Huds only get respositioned when PlayGui is loaded, 
		so starting and leaving without playing will fuck up your hud setup.
		
		This standalone fix prevents that.
		
		Make sure this is loaded by 
		a) naming it  "HudMessupFix.acs.cs" and put into config/modules ... idiot proof way.
		or b) putting into autoexec.cs
		or c) exec it some other way
		
		GreyHound / Hunden
	*/
	
	$HudMessupFix::DoExport = false;
	
	//catch the case that restores the huds, if that happened, it's save to export them later
	function HudMessupFix::OnGuiOpen( %gui ) after Hud::OnGuiOpen {
		if ( %gui == "playGui" )
			$HudMessupFix::DoExport = true;
	}
	
	//make sure the shizzle just exports under our conditions
	function HudMessupFix::OnExit() before Hud::OnExit 
	{
		if($HudMessupFix::DoExport) //fine, don't halt
			return;
		
		echo("Sucky behavior detected and prevented.");
		halt;
	}
	
	.... damn this got annoying over time.
	
	Feel free to do the fix at it's source, in "core/Hud.cs" ... it's basicly a copy paste if you know what you're doing

8. FOV change
	$pref::playerfov = 110; 
	Default 90. Increases field of view to compensate for wide screen monitors. 

9. Terrain Smoothing change
	$pref:terrainlodamount = 0; 
	Default is 1. Decreases terrain warping at the expense of fps. 

10. Mission .dsc syntax error fix: by Plasmatic
	The following .dsc files have syntax errors, and don't show up in the create server gui.
	Misty links had multiple characters Tribes does not understand.
	opencall/missions/Sulfurious.dsc
	opencall/missions/Spartacus'sGauntlet.dsc
	opencall/missions/OneSmallStep.dsc
	opencall/missions/OlympusMons.dsc
	opencall/missions/MidnightMayhem.dsc
	opencall/missions/DarkAurora.dsc
	opencall/missions/CanyonCrusade.dsc
	lt/missions/MistyLinksLT.dsc
	opencall2/Integration.dsc
	
Unmentioned misc:
	$pref::OpenGL::useMultiTe xturing = "True"; Increases fps on some cards.
	$pref::OpenGL::flushAfter Passes = "False"; Increases fps on some cards.
	
11. Added opencall3 map pack 
	read the included read me file for information
	
12. Removed FOV change (see number 8) as it was overriding other stupid settings. 

13. End of line. JUMP!
