OPEN CALL 3 MAP PACK
***********************

Thank you for downloading Open Call 3.  This pack includes new textures, terrains, skies, objects and sounds.  We hope you enjoy playing these maps as much as we did making them.

Even in 2011, just 5 months shy of Tribes 1's 13th birthday, we hope that the successor to 2002's Open Call 2 is as symbolic of Tribes's resilience as it is symbolic of its brilliance.
